I recently built two different apps, one with React Native and another with 
Swift. After building both apps, I have concluded what I **think** is the better framework.

**Note**: The reason I am not including Flutter is because:

A) I haven't worked with it\
B) It doesn't produce Native code at the end

## TLDR
Swift. It is a great language and has all the packages you need (no need to fear
of deprecating packages), and allows amazing APIs. 

React Native definitely would be faster for developing two apps.

## Developer Experience (DX)

In terms of developer experience, I think that both React Native and Swift are
fine. If you come from a primary web background, you might find React Native a 
tad bit easier but in most cases, React Native has a very similar syntax to 
SwiftUI.

The main difference comes within the languages Swift vs React + TS and the APIs 
they offer. React is fairly hard to start with if you have never used it 
before, but since I used it before I would say it is a little easier than
Swift. Both TS and Swift are still really good languages, however, in some
edge cases Swift can be simpler.

**Verdict:** Depends on your background, however, I would say Swift is a little
bit easier to learn and use.

**Typescript**
```ts
const Page = {
  START: "START",
  GAME1: "GAME1",
  GAME2: "GAME2",
  GAME3: "GAME3",
} as const

type AllowedPages = typeof Page[keyof typeof Page]

function displayPage(page: AllowedPages) {
  switch (page) {
    case Page.START:
      console.log("start")
    case Page.GAME1:
      console.log("game1")
    case Page.GAME2:
      console.log("game2")
    case Page.GAME3:
      console.log("game3")
  }
}

displayPage(Page.START)
```

**Swift**
```swift
enum Page {
  case START
  case GAME1
  case GAME2
  case GAME3
}

func displayPage(page: Page) {
  switch page {
    case .START:
      print("start")
    case .GAME1:
      print("game1")
    case .GAME2:
      print("game2")
    case .GAME3:
      print("game3")
  }
}

displayPage(Page.START)
```

## Performance

In terms of performance, **Swift is the winner**.

Simply trying to run React Native
on two platforms means that the performance is going to take a hit.

Swift is also a compiled language, meaning that it will naturally run faster than React Native. However, React Native sometimes beats Swift in terms of 
memory usage.

**Verdict:** Swift, however, most of the time React Native is good enough.

## Speed of development

This is where **React Native truly shines**.

React Native is a framework that allows you to build apps for both iOS and
Android simultaneously. This means you can build two apps in a very short
amount of time.

**Verdict:** React Native

## Stability

This is where **Swift shines**.

Since Swift was made by Apple, it is very stable and is guaranteed to be
supporting new features for a long time.

React Native, on the other hand, is a framework made by Facebook. This means
that it will always be one step behind Apple, which can be a problem if you
want to try new features. It also means that React Native can be deprecated
at any time.

I don't think we need a graph for this one.

**Verdict:** Swift

## Packages

This is where **React Native can be the worst**.

Even though React Native has a lot of packages, it is very hard to find a
package that is not deprecated or will support new features. 

This is because React Native doesn't have a true official package list, and the community is forced to make its own. You are essentially relying on a couple
or even one person to maintain a package.

Swift (and Flutter) on the other hand, have an official package manager. Apple
makes sure that all packages are up to date and will support new features.
Google makes official packages for Flutter as well.

The last thing you want is a new version of iOS to come out and the package
you depended on to be deprecated and not supported for that version.

**Verdict**: Swift, it has more stable packages.

## Conclusion

In the end, I think that **Swift is the better framework**. 

It is more stable, has better performance, and has more stable packages.

However, React Native is still a great framework. It is very fast to develop
two apps at once, and it is very easy to learn if you are coming from a web
background, but Swift is still the better framework.

The major factor that made me choose Swift over React Native is the fact that
it is more stable. I don't want to be worrying about if my app will break if a
new version of iOS comes out, or if a package will be deprecated.
